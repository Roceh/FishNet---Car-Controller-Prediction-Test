# Fishnet client side predicted car controller example

This is my attempt at trying to adapt an existing car controller to use Fishnets client side prediction.  

I may well have done things wrong here as this is my go with CSP, but it seems to work resonably well. 

Project was done in unity 2021.3.2f1
